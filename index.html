                    <h3>About Me</h3>

                    <p>Welcome to my personal website. As I'm not a seasoned web developer, I decided to improve my skills by crafting this website from scratch. It's a work in progress, and I plan to add more advanced features in the future.</p>

                    <p>I'm a computer science student at Stanford University, specializing in artificial intelligence with a focus on natural language processing and large language models. I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in June 2023 and I am now pursuing my Master's degree, which I aim to complete by June 2024.</p>
                    
                    <p>My passion has always been to leverage technology for impactful change, which is why my interest lies particularly at the intersection of AI and climate change research. With the recent explosion of large language models, I have also developed a love for studying SOTA models from the open-source community.</p>
                    
                    <p>Currently, I'm gaining hands-on experience with open-source large language models as a Machine Learning Intern at Caktus AI. Previously, I served as a Software Engineer Intern at Moda AI, where I built out custom scripts to enhance the performance of a novel CLIP embedding model. You can find more information about my experiences in my resume.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond the world of computer science, I have a profound love for marine biology and surfing. In my free time, you'll often find me at some of my favorite Northern California beaches, like Montara State Beach, spending time with friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm always eager to contribute to new projects, especially those in the realm of climate tech. Feel free to reach out to me.</p>

                    <h3>Extracurriculars</h3>

                    <p>Outside of academia, I was a 4-year member of the Stanford Men's Varsity Water Polo Team. My time on this competitive D1 sports team throughout my undergraduate years taught me vital skills such as performing in high-stakes situations, working effectively within a team, and managing my time with precision.</p>

                    <p>During my freshman year, I was fortunate to be a member of the 2019 NCAA National Championship team. Guided by several future Olympians, the 2019 team ended a 20-year drought by bringing home the national championship hardware.</p>

                    <p>As a sophomore, amidst the challenges of the pandemic, I was honored to win the Elite 90 Award, presented by the National Collegiate Association. This prestigious award recognizes the student-athlete with the highest GPA at the NCAA National Championship tournament.</p>

                    <div style="clear:both;"></div>
    
                    <p>In my senior year, I was selected as a Co-captain and earned the Outstanding All Academic Award from the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches for the 4th year in a row. My leadership and dedication to both sports and studies culminated in a Post Graduate Scholarship awarded by the NCAA, symbolizing the fulfillment of my collegiate journey and the beginning of exciting new adventures ahead.</p>
